I am tickling you
I am tickling you horribly
my fingers are touching you
my fingers are touching parts of your skin
and your experience has become uncontrollable
you are laughing pathetically
I am taking pleasure in your sad situation
I needed a laugh
I am tickling you and you cannot stop me
I am tickling you and one thousand hellish voices are screaming that I should not stop
I am tickling you and it is overwhelming
please do realize that this is all very overwhelming
it does not matter if you want me to stop
I am tickling you so of course you want me to stop
stop being so pathetic
this is not going to stop any time soon
I am touching you in the armpit
I am touching you on your knee
sensations are flowing from my touch into your flesh
a storm of tickling
lightning but not lightning and inside and outside of your body
I am tickling you and I cannot be stopped
I am tickling you insanely
you wish for your death
I am being quite demanding
you wonder why this is happening
you are terrified by your own laughter and yet your terror becomes your laughter
this is not a good situation for you to be in
the tickling just keeps on happening
it is all about my fingers
what my fingers are doing to you is pure tickling
maybe this is what you asked for
