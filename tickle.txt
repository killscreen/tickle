I am tickling you
I am tickling you horribly
my fingers are touching you
my fingers are touching parts of your skin
and your experience has become uncontrollable
you are laughing pathetically
I am taking pleasure in your sad situation
I needed a laugh
I am tickling you and you cannot stop me
I am tickling you and one thousand hellish voices are screaming that I should not stop
I am tickling you and it is overwhelming
please do realize that this is all very overwhelming
it does not matter if you want me to stop
I am tickling you so of course you want me to stop
stop being so pathetic
this is not going to stop any time soon
I am touching you in the armpit
I am touching you on your knee
sensations are flowing from my touch into your flesh
a storm of tickling
lightning but not lightning and inside and outside of your body
I am tickling you and I cannot be stopped
I am tickling you insanely
you wish for your death
I am being quite demanding
you wonder why this is happening
you are terrified by your own laughter and yet your terror becomes your laughter
this is not a good situation for you to be in
the tickling just keeps on happening
it is all about my fingers
what my fingers are doing to you is pure tickling
maybe this is what you asked for
all that is happening to you right now is touching that makes you make sounds
you laugh because it is so hard not to laugh
I will not let you stop laughing
I will not let you have peace
my tickles are covering your body and you will not escape
your eyes are wide
you can barely breathe
you wonder when it will end or if it will end
you want to be saved from all the tickling
nobody has tickled you the way I tickle you
you have never experienced anything like this before
the tickling overwhelms your consciousness
you become a perpetual victim of my trickling touch
everything is a nightmare
my hands reach and my fingers touch
wherever I can find a sensitive spot my fingertips begin to dance
your flesh has become my colony
my tickles possess you
and more tickling is coming believe me
